1. Fund Me Contract Development
1.1 New Token Mint
Functionality: Allows project creators to mint a new token specific to their project.
Use Case: Tokens can represent ownership, a share of future profits, or other project-specific utilities.
1.2 New NFT Mint
Functionality: Enables minting NFTs that signify a contribution, with metadata to include rarity, voting rights, profit shares, and other entitlements.
Metadata Structure:
Voting Rights (bool)
Project Open Source or Closed Source (bool)
Governance Model (DAO, single owner, etc.)
Profit Distribution Ratios
Transferability (bool)
Additional entitlements based on contribution tiers
1.3 Project Configuration
Customization Options: Creators can configure various parameters, including NFT rarity, percentage of trade fees, and product discounts or benefits tied to NFT ownership.
Naming Convention: Each project must have a unique name following the format 'Fund <name>'.
2. Contract Factory Development
2.1 Token and NFT Requirement for Launch
Payment Options: Creators can launch a project by holding a platform-specific NFT or using the platform's token. Alternative payment methods include swapping to the platform's token or using local chain currency from an approved list.
Factory Mechanics: Upon receiving the necessary payment or holding verification, the factory deploys a new instance of the Fund Me contract with the creator's specified configurations.
3. ReactJS Frontend Development
3.1 Dynamic Page and Tile Generation
Marketplace Page: Each new project launch by the factory generates a new tile on the marketplace page, showcasing available projects for funding.
Project Detail Page: Clicking on a project tile opens a detailed page with full information about the project, including its funding goals, NFT/token details, and contribution mechanisms.
No Database Integration: Store project information within the blockchain contracts. Use web3 libraries (e.g., ethers.js) to interact with the contracts and display data on the frontend, minimizing the need for a traditional database.
Implementation Steps
Smart Contract Development:

Start with drafting the smart contracts for token and NFT minting, ensuring compliance with standards like ERC-20 for tokens and ERC-721/ERC-1155 for NFTs.
Develop the contract factory with the capability to deploy configured Fund Me contracts.
Security and Testing:

Prioritize comprehensive testing, including unit tests for contract functions and integration tests covering contract deployment and interactions.
Conduct security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, especially those related to fund handling and smart contract interactions.
Frontend Development:

Set up a ReactJS project, integrating web3 libraries for blockchain interactions.
Design UI components for the marketplace and project detail pages, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
Implement dynamic content rendering based on smart contract events and data.
Deployment and Feedback Loop:

Deploy the smart contracts to a testnet, integrating them with the frontend for a full MVP experience.
Gather user feedback from early testers to identify areas for improvement and additional features desired by your target audience.
Iterate and Scale:

Based on feedback, refine the MVP, focusing on enhancing user experience, expanding functionality, and ensuring scalability.
Plan for a mainnet launch, preparing for wider user adoption and potential platform growth.
By following this detailed plan, you'll be able to develop a Proof of Contribution Crowdfunding platform that leverages the unique benefits of blockchain technology, providing a novel way for projects to receive funding while offering contributors tangible benefits and rights through tokens and NFTs.
