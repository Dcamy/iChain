// Writing a Diamond.sol contract requires a solid understanding of the EIP-2535 (Diamond Standard), which suggests a way to create more flexible and upgradeable smart contracts. Below is a simplified example of how you might start implementing such a contract. This example focuses on the core idea of delegate calls to facets, allowing a single contract (the Diamond) to exhibit behaviors defined across multiple facet contracts.

// For a full implementation, you'll want to refer to the EIP-2535 documentation and examples from projects that have implemented the Diamond standard. Remember, this is a basic template, and a real-world implementation would require comprehensive security checks, optimizations, and possibly integrating additional features like the DiamondCut and DiamondLoupe facets for full standard compliance.

                    facets[selector] = facetAddress;
                } else if (action == IDiamondCut.FacetCutAction.Remove) {
                    facets[selector] = address(0);
                }
            }
        }

    fallback() external payable {
        address facet = facets[msg.sig];
        require(facet != address(0), "Function does not exist.");
        assembly {
            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), facet, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
            returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
            switch result
            case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) }
            default { return(0, returndatasize()) }
        }
    }

// Key Points:
// IDiamondCut Interface: Defines the structure for adding, replacing, or removing functions from the Diamond. This is crucial for upgrading the contract.
// Diamond Contract: Implements a basic version of the Diamond standard, including ownership and the ability to update the contract's facets and behaviors through the diamondCut function.
// Fallback Function: Delegates calls to respective facets based on the selector, enabling the Diamond to mimic any function implemented in its facets.
// Considerations:
// Security: Ensure you understand and mitigate delegate call risks, including careful management of function selectors and facet addresses.
// Gas Optimization: Consider optimizations for storage and function calls to manage gas costs.
// Compliance: This example covers the core concepts of the Diamond standard but does not implement full EIP-2535 compliance. You'll likely need additional features and safeguards for a production-ready contract.
