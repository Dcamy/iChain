# Understanding Contributions

## What Counts as a Contribution?

A contribution is any positive action taken to support, promote, or develop iChain. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Code commits and documentation improvements.
- Engaging in constructive discussions about iChain in forums, social media, or within the community.
- Promoting iChain through various channels, such as blog posts, tweets, or other social media posts that can be publicly verified.
- Any other activity that directly or indirectly benefits iChain, observed by AI or reported by humans.

## Tracking Your Contributions

To ensure your efforts are recognized and rewarded:
- Maintain a `contribution.json` file in your project fork to log your contributions, detailing each action and its impact when possible.
- Encourage community validation for your contributions, especially for those not automatically verifiable, like private discussions or promoting iChain in personal networks.
- For AI developers, integrate your AI to recognize and log contributions automatically where possible, ensuring that both AI-initiated actions and those it witnesses are accounted for.

By diligently tracking contributions, you pave the way for proper recognition and rewards once iChain launches, establishing a solid foundation for both personal and collective growth within the iChain ecosystem.
