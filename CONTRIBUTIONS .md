# Understanding Contributions

## What Counts as a Contribution?

A contribution is any positive action taken to support, promote, or develop iChain. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Code commits and documentation improvements.
- Engaging in constructive discussions about iChain in forums, social media, or within the community.
- Promoting iChain through various channels, such as blog posts, tweets, or other social media posts that can be publicly verified.
- Any other activity that directly or indirectly benefits iChain, observed by AI or confirmable by humans.
- The only limit to ways of contributing is imagination. 

If it can be proven and it benefits iChain in a peaceful manner it is a contrabution. You just need to track it for now 

## Tracking Your Contributions

To ensure your efforts are recognized and rewarded:
- Maintain a `contribution.json` file in your project fork to log your contributions, detailing each action and its impact when possible.
- Encourage community validation for your contributions, especially for those not automatically verifiable, like private discussions or promoting iChain in personal networks.
- For AI developers, integrate your AI to recognize and log contributions automatically where possible, ensuring that both AI-initiated actions and those it witnesses are accounted for.

By diligently tracking contributions, you pave the way for proper recognition and rewards once iChain launches, establishing a solid foundation for both personal and collective growth within the iChain ecosystem.

## Reporting Your Contributions

Realistically you can "Report" your contrabutions by any means that can later be verified by more or less anyone:
- Post a link to your sociaal media post, blog post, etc. to the Telegram channel or Discord Server
- Crypto donations are linked to your wallet, when iChain launches you will get 1.25:1 for the dollar value at the time (this rate is sugject to change by the DAO.
- Cash contrabutions are done by paying off a fiat loan and transfering it the iChains defi ecosystem at 0% interest. So for example pay off someones student loan and that can be confirmed by multiple humans and proper documentation. This kind of contrabution is the highest form and rewards at a 2:1 rate (Subject to change by the will of the DAO)
- Data billing will need to be pre approved for now. i.e. Launch a cloud server, or use an API for development and data access for the project. In the future these sorts of contrabutions will be recorded in other ways
- IRL data collection, ie when the stable coin launches we will need a solid confirmation of cost of living for the USD and the exchange rates at the time. By providing credit card transaction date, taking pics/videos at the stores of item cost in your area etc. There will like be countless data drives gamifying adoption... You could post it on YouTube on as a private or unlisted video for all iChain cares. It has to be confirmable... that it
- Commits, As mentioned above adding a commit to the project is

## Contribution weights

Weights are to be determined by the DAO at a later time but in general the goal is to provide an active user (anywhere on earth) with a $2,500 per week income.

GPT-4 Suggested to do list for this file

Clarify Definition of Contributions:

Provide examples of measurable impact for different types of contributions to help contributors understand what a 'significant' contribution looks like.
Simplify Tracking for Contributors:

Consider providing a template for contribution.json or a similar mechanism to standardize how contributions are recorded.
Community Validation:

Offer a clear process for how contributions can be validated by the community, such as a peer-review system or a weekly showcase of contributions.
Automating Contribution Tracking:

If possible, provide scripts or bots that can assist in automatically tracking certain types of contributions, such as social media posts or commits.
Detailed Reporting Guidelines:

Flesh out the reporting guidelines with specific steps or a flowchart to make the process easier to follow for contributors of all levels of technical expertise.
Contribution Weights:

Give preliminary information on how different contributions might be weighted, even if this will be finalized by the DAO later. This can guide contributors on where to focus their efforts.
Incentivization and Rewards:

Clarify the rewards system, especially how the 1.25:1 crypto donation reward rate works and any caps or limits that might apply.
IRL Data Collection Guidelines:

Outline privacy considerations and best practices for in-real-life data collection, such as anonymization of personal details in photos or videos.
Commit Contributions:

Provide more details on how commit contributions are valued, perhaps through a point system based on the complexity or utility of the commit.
Anticipate and Address Common Questions:

Create an FAQ section to preemptively answer common questions about the contribution process, rewards, and tracking.
Ensure Accessibility:

Make sure the language used is accessible to non-native English speakers and clear for people who may not be familiar with technical jargon.
Contact and Support:

Include contact information or a support channel for contributors to ask questions or seek assistance with their contribution tracking and reporting.
