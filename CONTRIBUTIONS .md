# Understanding Contributions

## What Counts as a Contribution?

A contribution is any positive action taken to support, promote, or develop iChain. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Code commits and documentation improvements.
- Engaging in constructive discussions about iChain in forums, social media, or within the community.
- Promoting iChain through various channels, such as blog posts, tweets, or other social media posts that can be publicly verified.
- Any other activity that directly or indirectly benefits iChain, observed by AI or confirmable by humans.
- The only limit to ways of contributing is imagination. 

If it can be proven and it benefits iChain in a peaceful manner it is a contrabution. You just need to track it for now 

## Tracking Your Contributions

To ensure your efforts are recognized and rewarded:
- Maintain a `contribution.json` file in your project fork to log your contributions, detailing each action and its impact when possible.
- Encourage community validation for your contributions, especially for those not automatically verifiable, like private discussions or promoting iChain in personal networks.
- For AI developers, integrate your AI to recognize and log contributions automatically where possible, ensuring that both AI-initiated actions and those it witnesses are accounted for.

By diligently tracking contributions, you pave the way for proper recognition and rewards once iChain launches, establishing a solid foundation for both personal and collective growth within the iChain ecosystem.

## Reporting Your Contributions

Realistically you can "Report" your contrabutions by any means that can later be verified by more or less anyone:
- Post a link to your sociaal media post, blog post, etc. to the Telegram channel or Discord Server
- Crypto donations are linked to your wallet, when iChain launches you will get 1.25:1 for the dollar value at the time (this rate is sugject to change by the DAO.
- Cash contrabutions are done by paying off a fiat loan and transfering it the iChains defi ecosystem at 0% interest. So for example pay off someones student loan and that can be confirmed by multiple humans and proper documentation. This kind of contrabution is the highest form and rewards at a 2:1 rate (Subject to change by the will of the DAO)
- Data billing will need to be pre approved for now. i.e. Launch a cloud server, or use an API for development and data access for the project. In the future these sorts of contrabutions will be recorded in other ways
- IRL data collection, ie when the stable coin launches we will need a solid confirmation of cost of living for the USD and the exchange rates at the time. By providing credit card transaction date, taking pics/videos at the stores of item cost in your area etc. There will like be countless data drives gamifying adoption... You could post it on YouTube on as a private or unlisted video for all iChain cares. It has to be confirmable... that it
