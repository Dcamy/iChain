Absolutely, I can put that together for you. Here's how the markdown file would look:


# High-Level Plan for MVP Development

## MVP Scope
Define the core features for the MVP:
- Project cards
- User profiles linked to wallets
- Basic project statistics
Ensure responsiveness for desktop and mobile.

## Technical Stack
Choose frontend technologies:
- React framework
- Redux for state management (if necessary)
- Styled-components or UI library
Select blockchain interaction libraries:
- web3.js or ethers.js

## IPFS Integration
Plan the integration with IPFS for:
- Storing and serving project images
- Handling project descriptions

## User Wallet Integration
Decide on wallet integration methods for profile authentication:
- MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.

## Frontend Structure
Establish directory structure and initial files:
- Maintainable and scalable architecture

## Design Iterations
Focus on UI/UX design elements:
- Hover effects for project cards on desktop
- Alternative interactions for mobile

## Start Coding
Begin with basic functionality:
- Data fetching from Google Sheets
- Set up IPFS integration for static content

## Testing and Documentation
Implement testing and thorough documentation:
- Unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library
- Clear documentation for setup and contribution

# Directory Structure and Essential Files

/project-root
  /public          # Static files like index.html, favicon, etc.
  /src
    /components    # Stateless components like buttons, cards
    /containers    # Stateful components connected to Redux or context
    /contexts      # React context for global state like user info
    /hooks         # Custom React hooks
    /utils         # Utility functions and constants
    /services      # Services for external API calls
    /assets        # Static assets like images, icons, fonts
    /styles        # Global styles, themes for styled-components
    App.js         # Main app component
    index.js       # Entry point for the React app
  .env.example    # Template for environment variables
  .gitignore      # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
  README.md       # Project documentation
  package.json    # Dependencies and scripts
  /tests          # Testing scripts and test cases

`.env.example` should include placeholders for any sensitive/API information required to run the project. `.gitignore` should at least include `node_modules`, `.env`, and any build files. `README.md` should outline the project's purpose, how to set it up and run it locally, and how to contribute.

# Starting to Code

1. **Project Setup:** Initialize the project using Create React App or a similar setup.
2. **Component Structure:** Build project cards, hover details, and profile connection button.
3. **State Management:** Set up Redux or Context API as needed.
4. **Data Integration:** Connect to Google Sheets API for project data.
5. **IPFS Integration:** Implement content handling via IPFS.
6. **User Wallet Integration:** Securely integrate wallet connection.
7. **Responsive Design:** Ensure all components work across different devices.
8. **Testing:** Write tests for new components.
9. **Documentation:** Document all parts of the application.
10. **Iterate:** Continuously improve based on feedback.

This plan provides a clear path to kickstart the project, focusing on creating a strong foundation for future development.



Just save this text with a `.md` extension, for example `project-plan.md`, and it should be ready to be viewed or edited with any markdown editor or directly on platforms like GitHub.
