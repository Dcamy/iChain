/*
You're welcome! It's great to hear that the updates and integrations are helping streamline the process for you. Now, let's focus on creating the UserProfile.js component. This component will utilize the useWallet hook to display and manage user profile information, including wallet connection status and potentially other user-specific data like preferences or project involvement.

Here's a basic setup for UserProfile.js:

javascript
Copy code
*/
import React from 'react';
import { useWallet } from '../hooks/useWallet';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const ProfileContainer = styled.div`
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  margin: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: var(--background-dark);
  color: var(--text-light);
`;

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: var(--interactive-neon);
  border: none;
  padding: 10px 15px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  color: white;
  margin-top: 10px;

  &:hover {
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
`;

const UserProfile = () => {
  const { walletAddress, isConnected, connectWallet } = useWallet();

  return (
    <ProfileContainer>
      <h2>User Profile</h2>
      {isConnected ? (
        <div>
          <p>Wallet Address: {walletAddress}</p>
          {/* Display additional user profile information here */}
        </div>
      ) : (
        <Button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</Button>
      )}
    </ProfileContainer>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
/*
In this component:

We use the useWallet hook to access the user's wallet information, such as whether they are connected (isConnected) and their wallet address (walletAddress).
If the user is connected, their wallet address is displayed. You can extend this section to include more user profile information as your application develops, such as links to their funded projects or preferences.
If the user is not connected, a button is displayed that allows them to connect their wallet. The connectWallet function triggered by this button would typically prompt the user to connect their wallet through a browser extension like MetaMask.
This setup provides a basic user profile interface that can be expanded with more detailed information and functionality as needed. It lays the groundwork for integrating user-specific data and actions within your application, enhancing the personalization and interactivity of the user experience.

As you build out and refine your application, consider how you might incorporate additional features into the user profile, such as displaying funded projects, user preferences for GPT-3 generated content, or even transaction history. If you have specific functionalities in mind for the user profile, feel free to discuss them, and I can provide further guidance on implementing those ideas.
