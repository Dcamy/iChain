/*
Sure, if you're fetching project involvement data from the blockchain, you'd typically interact with a smart contract that can provide this information. Assuming you have a contract method that returns the projects a user is involved in, your useProjects hook might make a call to this method.

Here's how you might flesh out UserDashboard.js to include fetching from the blockchain:

javascript
Copy code
*/
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import UserProfile from '../components/UserProfile';
import ProjectList from './ProjectList';
import { useWallet } from '../hooks/useWallet'; // Assuming useWallet provides the walletAddress
import styled from 'styled-components';

const DashboardContainer = styled.div`
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 20px;
`;

// This function would interact with your smart contract
async function fetchUserProjects(walletAddress) {
  // Use ethers or web3 to make a contract call
  // const userProjects = await contract.getUserProjects(walletAddress);
  // return userProjects;
}

const UserDashboard = () => {
  const { walletAddress } = useWallet();
  const [userInvolvedProjects, setUserInvolvedProjects] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadUserProjects() {
      if (!walletAddress) return;
      setLoading(true);
      try {
        const projects = await fetchUserProjects(walletAddress);
        setUserInvolvedProjects(projects);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching user projects:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }

    loadUserProjects();
  }, [walletAddress]);

  return (
    <DashboardContainer>
      <UserProfile />
      {loading ? (
        <div>Loading your projects...</div>
      ) : (
        <ProjectList projects={userInvolvedProjects} />
      )}
    </DashboardContainer>
  );
};

export default UserDashboard;
/* In this code:

We added a new function, fetchUserProjects, which you'd use to interact with your smart contract and fetch the list of projects the user is involved in. You'd need to implement this function based on how your smart contract is set up.
The useEffect hook is used to call loadUserProjects whenever the wallet address changes, which should be a dependency of the effect.
The state variables userInvolvedProjects and loading are used to keep track of the projects and whether the application is currently fetching data.
The UserDashboard returns a loading state if fetching is in progress or the ProjectList component with the user's projects once the data has been fetched.
You would need to replace the placeholder comments and function bodies with actual calls to your smart contract, using a library like ethers.js or web3.js.

This structure assumes that you have a way to directly query the blockchain for the data needed. If your contract structure is complex, you might need more sophisticated state management or caching strategies, but this will give you a solid foundation to start from.
