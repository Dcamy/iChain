Sure thing! Based on the provided concept, I'll outline the directory structure with a focus on the frontend architecture which, given our context, seems to be a React application that interacts with blockchain contracts.

# Frontend Directory and File Structure

## Public Directory: `/public`

This directory contains all the static assets such as `index.html`, images, and manifest file.

**favicon.ico:** The icon for the web application.

**index.html:** The main HTML file that includes mounting points for React components.

## Src Directory: `/src`

The `src` directory will house the main source code for the React application.

**App.js:** The root React component that wraps the entire application.

**index.js:** The JavaScript entry point for the React app that renders the App component.

## Components Directory: `/src/components`

This directory will hold all the stateless React components such as buttons, cards, and form inputs.

**ProjectCard.js:** A component that displays project information in a card format.

**UserProfile.js:** Renders user profile information, allowing wallet connection.

## Containers Directory: `/src/containers`

Containers are React components connected to the global state or context providers.

**ProjectList.js:** Fetches and displays a list of ProjectCard components.

**UserDashboard.js:** Manages the state and logic for the user's profile and wallet interactions.

## Contexts Directory: `/src/contexts`

Here we will keep the React contexts for global state management like user authentication status.

**WalletContext.js:** Stores the state of the user's wallet connection and profile information.

## Hooks Directory: `/src/hooks`

Custom React hooks for reusable stateful logic such as fetching data or interacting with blockchain.

**useProjects.js:** A hook for fetching project data from Google Sheets or the blockchain.

**useWallet.js:** Manages the logic for connecting to the user's wallet.

## Utils Directory: `/src/utils`

Utility functions and constants used throughout the application.

**constants.js:** Holds the constants like API endpoints or IPFS gateways.

**helpers.js:** Utility functions for common tasks like formatting dates or numbers.

## Services Directory: `/src/services`

Services for handling external API calls or blockchain interactions.

**api.js:** Service functions for calling external APIs or smart contract methods.

## Assets Directory: `/src/assets`

Static assets like images, icons, and fonts that are used in the React components.

## Styles Directory: `/src/styles`

Global styles and themes for the application. This could be CSS files, styled-components, or a theme file for a UI library.

**GlobalStyles.js:** A file for global styled-components.

## Tests Directory: `/src/tests`

Testing scripts and test cases for the React components and custom hooks.

**ProjectCard.test.js:** Tests for the ProjectCard component.

**useProjects.test.js:** Tests for the `useProjects` hook.

## Root Directory Files

**.env.example:** A template for the required environment variables.

**.gitignore:** Specifies files and directories that should not be committed to the repository, such as `node_modules` and `.env`.

**README.md:** Documentation detailing the project setup, build process, and how to run tests.

**package.json:** Defines the project dependencies and scripts for tasks like starting the dev server and running tests.

**/scripts:** Directory containing scripts for tasks like initializing the project, deployment, and other utilities.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns within the application, making it easier for developers to navigate and maintain. Each directory and file has a specific purpose, promoting modular code and making the application scalable as new features and services are added.
