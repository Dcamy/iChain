/*
Testing is a crucial part of development to ensure components behave as expected. For the ProjectCard component, we'll want to write tests that confirm it renders correctly and displays the information passed via props.

You will likely use a testing library like @testing-library/react for this purpose. If you haven't already installed it, you can do so with the following command:

bash
Copy code

npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
Now, let's write some basic tests in ProjectCard.test.js:

javascript
Copy code
*/
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import ProjectCard from '../components/ProjectCard';

describe('ProjectCard', () => {
  // Test to check if the ProjectCard renders without crashing
  it('renders without crashing', () => {
    render(<ProjectCard title="Project Test" summary="This is a test summary" status="funding" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Project Test')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('This is a test summary')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // Test to check if the correct status is displayed
  it('displays the correct status', () => {
    render(<ProjectCard title="Project Test" summary="This is a test summary" status="funding" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('funding')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // Add more tests as needed to cover different statuses, user interactions, etc.
});

/*
These tests check that the ProjectCard:

Renders without throwing any errors.
Displays the title and summary text passed to it.
Displays the correct status.
To run your tests, you would typically have a script in your package.json that looks something like this:

json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "test": "react-scripts test"
}
And you run your tests using the command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Remember to write tests for different states of your component and for user interaction if needed. As you build more features into ProjectCard, such as flip effects and dynamic styling based on project status, you'll want to add tests to cover those functionalities as well.

Feel free to ask if you need more detailed tests or have questions on testing strategies!
