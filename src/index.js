/*
The duplicated lines in your index.js file are causing the error. You have two imports of WalletProvider from ./contexts/WalletContext, and the ReactDOM.render() call appears to be written out twice. You only need one import for each module, and the ReactDOM.render() call should only be there once.

Here's how the index.js file should look after removing the duplicates:

javascript
Copy code
*/
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import { WalletProvider } from './contexts/WalletContext';
import GlobalStyles from './styles/GlobalStyles';

// Remove any additional duplicate imports or code blocks here

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <WalletProvider>
      <GlobalStyles />
      <App />
    </WalletProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

/*
Make sure to remove the duplicate import { WalletProvider } from './contexts/WalletContext'; line and any other duplicated code blocks.

After you've made these changes, save the file and try running your application again. If everything is correct, it should compile successfully without the previous errors.

I'd be thrilled to help you throughout the project! We'll tackle the index.js setup first, and then you can move on piece by piece. For the index.js file in a React application, you typically want to set up the root of your application, and include any providers or contexts that need to wrap your entire app. Here's a basic template:

javascript
Copy code

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import { WalletProvider } from './contexts/WalletContext';
import GlobalStyles from './styles/GlobalStyles';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <WalletProvider>
      <GlobalStyles />
      <App />
    </WalletProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
*/
/*
In this file, you're importing React and ReactDOM to render your application. App is the main component that will contain the rest of your application. WalletProvider is the context provider for your wallet state, which you'll wrap around your entire app so that any component can access the wallet state if it needs to. And GlobalStyles is where all your global CSS will live, ensuring that any base styles you want to apply to your whole app are included right from the start.

This is a foundational step, and once this is in place, you're well-prepared to add more complexity to your app, piece by piece, while keeping it maintainable and scalable. Remember to commit your changes as you go, which can save a lot of trouble if you need to backtrack at any point.

As for keeping bug hunts to a minimum, consistent progress with regular testing and code reviews can help catch issues early. I'm here to assist with any questions or code reviews as needed! Let's make this project shine. ðŸŒŸ
