// Creating a DiamondCutFacet.sol involves implementing the functionality to add, replace, and remove facets within the Diamond, according to the EIP-2535 standard. This facet essentially controls the modification of the Diamond's structure, allowing it to evolve over time without the need for redeployment. Here's how you could structure such a facet:


// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./IDiamondCut.sol";

contract DiamondCutFacet is IDiamondCut {
    // This event is emitted for each successful facet cut.
    event DiamondCut(FacetCut[] _facetCuts, address _init, bytes _calldata);

    // Function to add, replace, or remove functions in the Diamond.
    function diamondCut(
        FacetCut[] calldata _facetCuts,
        address _init,
        bytes calldata _calldata
    ) external override {
        // Ensure only the diamond owner or another authorized mechanism can perform cuts.
        require(msg.sender == address(this) || isOwner(), "Unauthorized");

        // Loop through each requested facet cut.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _facetCuts.length; i++) {
            FacetCutAction action = _facetCuts[i].action;
            bytes4[] memory functionSelectors = _facetCuts[i].functionSelectors;
            address facetAddress = _facetCuts[i].facetAddress;

            // Apply the facet cut as requested.
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < functionSelectors.length; j++) {
                if (action == FacetCutAction.Add || action == FacetCutAction.Replace) {
                    // Ensure not trying to add to a zero address.
                    require(facetAddress != address(0), "Add/Replace to 0 address");

                    // Add or replace a function selector.
                    // NOTE: Actual storage structure to track selectors-to-facet address mapping needed.
                } else if (action == FacetCutAction.Remove) {
                    // Ensure not removing to a non-zero address for safety.
                    require(facetAddress == address(0), "Remove to non-0 address");

                    // Remove a function selector.
                    // NOTE: Actual storage structure to track selectors-to-facet address mapping needed.
                }
            }
        }

        emit DiamondCut(_facetCuts, _init, _calldata);

        // Initialize the facet.
        initializeCut(_init, _calldata);
    }

    // Internal function to initialize a facet after a cut.
    function initializeCut(address _init, bytes memory _calldata) internal {
        if(_init == address(0)) return; // If no init function, exit early.

        // Ensure the data is not empty.
        require(_calldata.length > 0, "Calldata must not be empty");

        // Perform the delegatecall to the initialization function.
        (bool success, ) = _init.delegatecall(_calldata);
        require(success, "Initialization failed");
    }

    // Placeholder function for owner checks, to be replaced with your access control mechanism.
    function isOwner() internal view returns (bool) {
        // Implement ownership or access control check logic.
        return true;
    }
}

// Key Points:
// Facet Cuts: The contract implements the diamondCut method from the IDiamondCut interface to add, replace, or remove function selectors associated with facets.
// Event Emission: The DiamondCut event is emitted after each successful cut to provide transparency and traceability.
// Initialization: After a cut, if an initialization address (_init) and calldata (_calldata) are provided, the facet initializes the new or modified functionality. This step is crucial for setting up state or permissions in a newly added facet.
// Access Control: The isOwner function needs to be defined or replaced with your preferred access control mechanism to restrict who can perform diamond cuts.
// Next Steps:
// Implement Access Control: Replace the placeholder isOwner function with a robust access control mechanism, such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable or a more complex DAO governance model.
// Storage Structure for Function Selectors: Design and implement the storage structure that maps function selectors to their corresponding facet addresses. This is crucial for the Diamond to delegate calls correctly.
// Testing and Verification: Thoroughly test the DiamondCutFacet to ensure it correctly manages facet additions, replacements, and removals. Consider edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities, especially in the delegate call mechanism used in initializeCut.
// Remember, building on the Diamond standard requires careful consideration of security, especially when modifying contract functionalities on-the-fly. Regular audits and peer reviews are recommended to ensure the contract's integrity and security.
