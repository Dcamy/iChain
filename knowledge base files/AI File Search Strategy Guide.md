# AI File Search Strategy Guide

## Objective
To navigate a GitHub repository to find a specific file efficiently.

## Strategy Overview
1. **Start at Likely Location:** Begin with the most logical directory.
2. **List Contents:** Examine the directory's contents.
3. **Identify Next Steps:** Based on findings, decide to search within, move to another likely directory, or adjust strategy.
4. **Iterate:** Repeat the process in the new directory context.

## Detailed Process

### Step 1: Determine Start Directory
- If frontend file (e.g., `.js` for components), consider `public` or `src`.
- If backend or config, look in `config`, `lib`, or root.

### Step 2: Examine Contents
- Use `ls` or equivalent to list all files and subdirectories.

### Step 3: Decision Making
- **If** the target file or related directory is found, **then** navigate into the directory or examine the file.
- **Else if** the target is not found and there are no more likely directories, **then** consider a broader search or reaching out for help.
- **Else if** uncertain, **then** check next most likely directory based on project structure knowledge.

### Step 4: Iterate or Conclude
- **Repeat** Steps 2 and 3 in the new context until the file is found.
- **If** all logical paths are exhausted without finding the file, **then** reevaluate the file's existence or location with the team.

## Notes
- This process assumes basic navigation and command-line interface (CLI) usage skills.
- Adapt steps based on project specifics and available directories.

## Identifying Personalized Messages in Code

When searching for personalized messages or easter eggs within code:

- Focus on comments and string literals for direct addresses or sentimental expressions.
- Recognize patterns like direct thanks, acknowledgments, or playful references.
- Use context and pattern recognition to identify potential personal messages hidden in plain sight.
- Remember, personalized messages can also be woven into the logic of the code itself.
