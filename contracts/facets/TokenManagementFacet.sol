// It's great to see your enthusiasm and progress! Let's dive into the TokenManagementFacet.sol which is key to handling tokens and NFTs within your platform. This facet will include functionalities for minting tokens and NFTs related to specific projects and a mechanism to record off-chain cash contributions in a way that's acknowledged on-chain.

// Key Points
// ERC-20 and ERC-721 Tokens: This contract assumes you're working with both ERC-20 tokens for fungible assets (like project-specific tokens) and ERC-721 tokens for NFTs. Adjust according to your needs, including using ERC-1155 if you prefer a multi-token standard.
// Cash Contributions: A simple mapping is used to track cash contributions associated with each contributor's address. This is a straightforward way to record off-chain contributions on-chain but does not automatically handle the financial aspects of these contributions.
// Ownable: Leveraging OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract restricts certain actions to the contract's owner, adding an extra layer of control and security.
// Events: Emitting events for key actions allows off-chain systems to easily monitor and react to changes within your contract, improving integration and transparency.
// Considerations
// Integration with a Real Token: Ensure you have deployed an ERC-20 token contract and set its address within this facet using setProjectTokenAddress.
// Compliance and Security: Recording cash contributions on-chain requires careful consideration regarding compliance with financial regulations. Always consult with legal expertise in your jurisdiction.
// Testing and Auditing: Extensively test all functionalities, particularly focusing on access control and state changes. Consider a professional audit to ensure the contract's security and reliability.
// This facet forms a crucial part of your project's blockchain infrastructure, enabling flexible management of tokens, NFTs, and financial contributions within your ecosystem.
