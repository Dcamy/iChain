// Given the structure and logic you've outlined for the OwnershipFacet.sol, incorporating OpenZeppelin's contracts for reliable ownership management, and integrating DAO functionality, here's an approach to code it:

// First, ensure you have OpenZeppelin contracts installed in your project:

// bash
// Copy code
// npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
// Then, your OwnershipFacet.sol might look something like this:

// solidity
// Copy code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/IGovernor.sol";

contract OwnershipFacet is Ownable {
    address public daoAddress;
    event OwnershipTransferredToDAO(address indexed newDAO);
    event DAOAddressChanged(address indexed newDAO);

    constructor() {
        // Initial setup can go here
    }

    // Sets the DAO's address. Can only be called by the current owner.
    function setDAOAddress(address _daoAddress) public onlyOwner {
        require(_daoAddress != address(0), "DAO address cannot be zero");
        daoAddress = _daoAddress;
        emit DAOAddressChanged(_daoAddress);
    }

    // Allows transferring ownership to the DAO. This can replace the owner as the admin of the contract.
    function transferOwnershipToDAO() public onlyOwner {
        require(daoAddress != address(0), "DAO address is not set");
        emit OwnershipTransferredToDAO(daoAddress);
        // Logic to transfer ownership to the DAO
        // Depending on your governance model, this could mean setting the DAO as the new owner,
        // or it could involve more complex interactions with the governance contract.
    }

    // Modifier to check if the caller is the owner or a member of the DAO with voting power.
    modifier onlyOwnerOrDAO() {
        require(msg.sender == owner() || isDAOVoter(msg.sender), "Caller is not the owner or a DAO member with voting power");
        _;
    }

    // Checks if an address is a DAO member with voting power. This is a simplistic check.
    // You would implement your DAO's logic here to verify membership and voting power.
    function isDAOVoter(address _member) public view returns (bool) {
        // Example logic using the IGovernor interface from OpenZeppelin
        // This will depend on how your DAO is implemented and may require a more specific check
        return IGovernor(daoAddress).getVotes(_member, block.number - 1) > 0;
    }

    // An example function that requires ownership or DAO member authorization
    function exampleAdminFunction() public onlyOwnerOrDAO {
        // admin logic here
    }
}
// Key Implementation Details:
// OpenZeppelin's Ownable is used for robust, secure ownership management.
// DAO Governance: Functions are added to transition control from a single owner to a DAO, allowing for decentralized governance.
// onlyOwnerOrDAO Modifier: This ensures that certain actions can only be performed by the contract owner or a member of the DAO with sufficient voting power, blending individual and collective governance models.
// Event Emissions: Events like OwnershipTransferredToDAO and DAOAddressChanged provide transparency and auditability for key administrative actions.
// Next Steps:
// Testing: Rigorously test your contract, especially the interactions between individual ownership and DAO governance, to ensure security and correctness.
// Security Audits: Consider getting a professional audit, especially for the DAO integration parts, to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.
// Implementation Specifics: Depending on your DAO's structure, you might need to adjust the isDAOVoter function to accurately check for a member's voting power.
// Upgradability Consideration: If using a proxy pattern for upgradability, ensure that ownership and governance logic are compatible with your upgrade mechanism.
// This facet should be developed further to match the specific requirements of your governance model and thoroughly tested to ensure its security and effectiveness.
