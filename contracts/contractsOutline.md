# Directory and File Structure

## Contracts Directory: /contracts

This directory will contain all Solidity files (.sol) for the diamond, facets, and any additional contracts such as interfaces or libraries.

**Diamond.sol:** The main Diamond contract that follows the EIP-2535 standard. This contract handles the delegation of calls to various facets.

**DiamondCutFacet.sol:** A facet for adding, replacing, and removing functions. This is a core component of the Diamond standard that allows for upgrades and modifications.

**DiamondLoupeFacet.sol:** A facet that implements standard interfaces for inspecting which functions are available on the diamond and which facet they belong to.

**OwnershipFacet.sol:** Manages ownership of the diamond, allowing for governance and administrative actions.

## Facets Directory: /contracts/facets

Facets contain the logic of your application. You can organize your facets by functionality.

**ProjectManagementFacet.sol**
Contains logic for project creation, update, and management.
Functions: createProject, updateProject, getProjectDetails.

**TokenManagementFacet.sol**
Handles the minting of project-specific tokens and NFTs, including administrative functions for recording cash contributions.
Functions: mintToken, mintNFT, recordCashContribution.

**GovernanceFacet.sol**
If integrating a DAO for governance, this facet will manage proposals and voting.
Functions: createProposal, voteOnProposal, executeProposal.

## Interfaces Directory: /contracts/interfaces

Interfaces for any external contracts your facets interact with, such as ERC-20 or ERC-721 standards, DAOs, or other DeFi protocols.

**IERC20.sol**
**IERC721.sol**
**IDAO.sol**

## Libraries Directory: /contracts/libraries

Libraries used across multiple facets for reusable code.

**LibSafeMath.sol**
**LibArrays.sol**

## Implementation Details

**Diamond Storage:** Utilize the "diamond storage" pattern to safely store and access data across facets. This involves defining a struct in a library that is used by all facets to read and write data.

**Upgrade and Governance:** The DiamondCutFacet allows the diamond owner (which could be a DAO) to add, replace, and remove functionalities. This is critical for the upgradeability and maintenance of the platform. Ensure that governance processes are transparent and secure.

Modular Design: Each facet should be designed to operate independently, with clear interfaces between them. This modular approach simplifies updates and enhances security by isolating functionalities.

Interactions with External Contracts: Use interfaces to interact with external contracts such as ERC20 tokens, other NFT projects, or DAOs. This decouples your core logic from specific implementations, allowing for greater flexibility.

Security Considerations: Given the complexity of the Diamond standard and the financial nature of your project, thorough security audits are essential. Pay special attention to facets related to funds management and governance actions.

Testing: Develop comprehensive tests for each facet and the diamond as a whole. Testing should cover all functionalities, upgrade paths, and interactions between facets and with external contracts.

Deployment Scripts: Prepare deployment scripts in /scripts to deploy the diamond and its facets. This should include initializing the diamond with the DiamondCutFacet and other initial facets and settings.

Frontend Integration: Use Web3.js or Ethers.js in your frontend application to interact with the blockchain. The frontend should communicate with your contracts to display project information, handle contributions, and interact with governance mechanisms.

By following this structure and focusing on the key components of your platform, you can build a robust, upgradable, and flexible crowdfunding platform using the Diamond standard.
